## 💡 Background (Operator → Builder)
Before software development, I spent:
- **8 years** coordinating talent booking operations (scheduling, logistics, client communication)
- **4 years** running e-commerce brands as a solo founder (multi-market sales: US/EU/AU/Canada)

That experience taught me what great software should do — and what’s usually missing — which is why I now build workflow-focused systems.
